## Introduction
In computer science a Lexer or a tokenizer is a program that converts a sequence of characters (raw string) into a sequence of tokens. 

SwiLex is a universal lexer which means that you can use it to build *any* lexer only by defining your tokens in a Swift enum (in few lines of code). 

*And soon with **SwiParse** it will allow to build a full Parser.*

## Installation
SwiLex is distributed as a Swift Package using [SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

To install SwiLex, add the following line to the `dependencies` list in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/yassram/SwiLex.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.0.0")),
```

*SwiLex will support other dependency managers soon.*

## Usage

Import SwiLex to use it:

```swift
import SwiLex
```

### Simple Lexer example

Define a SwiLaxable enum to list your possible tokens with their corresponding regular expressions:

```swift 
enum WordNumberTokens: String, SwiLexable {
    static var separators: Set<Character> = [" "]
    
    case text = "[A-Za-z]*"
    case number = "[0-9]*"
}
```

Then create an instance of SwiLex and call the lex function:

```swift
var lexer = SwiLex<WordNumberTokens>()
let tokenList = try lexer.lex(input: "  H3Ll0   W0r 1d  1234 aBcD ")

// returns [text[H], number[3], text[Ll], number[0], text[W], number[0], 
//          text[r], number[1], text[d], number[1234], text[aBcD]]
```

This will return a list of tokens with the type of the token and its value (the matched string).

### Conditianal tokens Lexer example

SwiLex provides a mechanism for conditionally activating tokens. This tokens are only available for specific `Mode`.

In the following example we want to make the `.quotedString` token available only when the `.quote` mode is active.

Start by defining the possible `Mode`s.

```swift 
enum Modes {
    case normal
    case quote
}
```

Then define a SwiLaxable enum to list the possible tokens with their corresponding regular expressions (like for a simple Lexer):

```swift 
enum QuotedStringTextNumberTokens: String, SwiLexable {
    static var separators: Set<Character> = [" "]
    
    case text = "[A-Za-z]*"
    case number = "[0-9]*"
    case doubleQuote = "\""
    case quotedString = #"[^"]*"#
}
```

Next, define the tokens' availability for the possible modes by implementing the `activeForModes` property:

```swift
extension QuotedStringTextNumberTokens {
var activeForModes: Set<Modes> {
    switch self {
        case .doubleQuote:
            return [.quote, .normal]
        case .quotedString:
            return [.quote]
        default:
            return [.normal]
        }
    }
}
```
> - `.doubleQuote` is available for both `.normal` and `.quote` modes allowing to switch between them (by defining the end and the begining of a quote).<br>
> - `.quotedString` is only available for the `.quote` mode.<br>
> - All the other tokens are only availbale for the `.normal` mode. 

The last step is to tell when to change the curent mode. 

For that implement the function `changeMode(current mode: Modes?) -> Modes?`:

```swift
extension QuotedStringTextNumberTokens {
    func changeMode(current mode: Modes?) -> Modes? {
        switch self {
        case .doubleQuote:
            return mode == .normal ? .quote : .normal
        default:
            return mode
        }
    }
}
```

Finally create an instance of SwiLex and call the lex function with the initial mode:

```swift
let input = #"4lb3rt Einstein said "If you can't explain it to a 6 year old, you don't understand it yourself.""#

var lexer = SwiLex<QuotedStringTextNumberTokens>()
let tokenList = try lexer.lex(input: input, initialMode: .normal)

// [number[4], text[lb], number[3], text[rt], text[Einstein], text[said], doubleQuote["], 
//  quotedString[If you can't explain it to a 6 year old, you don't understand it yourself.], 
//  doubleQuote["]]

```

This will return a list of tokens with the type of the token and its value (the matched string).
